In this belt, it records when five warring nations; the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawk, buried their weapons of war to live in peace. Today, the Hiawatha Belt has been fashioned into a flag that has been flown in many places around the world."</p><br>

            <p>Syracuse University was founded March 13, 1870. I would like to acknowledge with respect the Onondaga Nation, firekeepers of the Haudenosaunee, the indigenous peoples on whose ancestral lands Syracuse University now stands. The Onondaga tribe, one of the five original nations of the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) Confederacy, was the political and geographical center of the league. With 14 seats in the council, the Onondaga furnished the chairman and the archivist, who kept the records of transactions in wampum belts. We must honor their sacred land as we practice our studying. As a student I hear about the Onondaga nation on the first day of classes every semester and it is a great reminder of who came before us.</p>
