            <p> I would consider myself a big foodie, meaning I love to eat and enjoy eating. My favorite place around syrcvase that do not involve the dining hall include:</p>

            <div> 
                <ol> 
                    <li>Oh my darling
                        <ul>  
                         Located: 321 S Salina St, Syracuse, NY 13202 
                        </ul>
                        <a href="https://darlingsyr.com/">OH MY DARLING WEBSITE </a>
                        <p>Oh, my darling has American style cuisine, and the ambiance is to die for. When my parents visit me, I always take them to Oh my darling. My go to is the Rosemary Hot Honey Crispy Chicken and the cookie skillet for dessert. They have everything from a Caesar salad to scallops. The vibes are immaculate, and everything is reasonably priced.</p>

                        <img src="my.jpg" alt="this is an image of food from oh my darling"></div>
                    <li> Pastabilities</li>
                        <ul> Located at 311 S Franklin St, Syracuse, NY 13202</ul>
                        <a href="http://www.pastabilities.com/">Pastabilities WEBSITE </a>
                        <p>Pastabilties, obviously known for their pasta is one of my favorites for a healthy serving of carbs. I love their fettuccini with pink vodka sauce. The line and wait are unbearable but somehow pastabilities makes the wait worth it.  </p>
                        <div class="food2"><img src="pasta.jpg" alt="this is an image of food from pastabilities"></div>
                    <li>Apizza regionale</li>
                        <ul>Located: 260 W Genesee St, Syracuse, NY 13202 </ul>
                        <a href="https://www.apizzaregionale.com/">APIZZA WEBSITE </a>
                        <p> Craving a really good oven baked pizza? Apizza regionale is your new go to. Aside for their amazing pizza they have fantastic pasta dishes feature LEONESSA LINGUINE. My favorite pizza is the Ruccilo. Apizza does might have a long wait on occasion, but the snap of the crust makes the experience worth it.</p>
