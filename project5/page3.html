    <h1>Ranking all of the dining halls on campus</h1>
    <p>Being that I do attend Syracuse university and how the university requires us to be on a meal plan for 2 years I must suffer through the dining hall food unfortunately. Here is how I rank the dining halls (the only places that take meal swipes)</p>
    <h2> BRING BACK SCHINE TAKING MEAL SWIPES</h2>
    <div> 
        <di> 
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Ernie Davis 
                </li>
           
                <ul> Make your own omelet station every Moring for breakfast, what a luxury. Other than that Ernie Davis gives me stomach problems. The ambiance is lacking though there is a lot of cement</ul>
                <div class="img1"><img src="ernie.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="ernie davis dining hall">
                    <div class="img7"><img src= "ernied.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="this is food from ernie davis"></div>
                <li>
                    Graham
                </li>
                <div class="img2"><img src="graham.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="this is an image of the ernie davis dining hall"></div>
                <ul>
                    Salad bar is elite, you can put grilled chicken on it and they have grilled cheese that you dont need to ask the sandwhich bar to make.</ul>
                   
                <li>Shaw</li>
                <div class="img3"><img src="shaw.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="this is an image of the rober shaw dining hall"></div>
                <ul>Milkshakes and a kosher section. The actual dining hall is very cute it looks like a upscale diner</ul>
                <li>Sadler</li>
                <div class="img4"><img src="sadler.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="this is an image of the sadler dining hall"></div>
                <ul> Painfully mid</ul>
                <div class="img5"><img src="sadler2.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="this is an image of the second picture of the sadler dining hall"></div>
                <li>BBB</li>
                <div class="img6"><img src="bbb.jpg" height="300px" width="300px" alt="this is an image the BBB dining hall"></div>
                <ul>I once got a waffle here and it was hard as a rock I could knock on it. Also BBB is not in the bast location. </ul>
            </ol>
