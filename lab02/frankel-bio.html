        <h1> this is <strong> Sarah Frankel</strong></h1>
       <p> I'm currently majoring in Information management and technology, and public health. IMT is such a dynamic major and is changing every day and more specifically within IMT, I'm interested in data analytics.
        Public health has really intrigued me this past year with covid and how each country is dealing with it and each demographic. 
        Outside of school I love snowboarding, playing lacrosse, and running. 
        One of my favorite accomplishments is that I won first place in a French poetry contest and that I raised 5,000 dollars for leukemia and lymphoma society.On-campus I’m involved in OrangeSeeds, U100, the women’s network, and PSP. I love dogs, I have a west highland terrier and I'm from long island, new york. </p>
