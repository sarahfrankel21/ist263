            <h1>Ranking all of the dining halls on campus</h1>
            <p>Being that I do attend Syracuse university and how the university requires us to be on a meal plan for 2 years I must suffer through the dining hall food unfortunately. Here is how I rank the dining halls (the only places that take meal swipes)</p>
            <h2> BRING BACK SCHINE TAKING MEAL SWIPES</h2>
            <div> 
                <di> 
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Ernie Davis 
                        </li>
                    <div class="img1"><img src="ernie.jpg" height="700px" width="800px" alt="this is an image of the Onondaga nation flag">
                    <img src= "ernied.jpg" alt="this is food from ernie davis"></div>
                        <ul> Make your own omelet station every Moring for breakfast, what a luxury. Other than that Ernie Davis gives me stomach problems. The ambiance is lacking though there is a lot of cement</ul>
                        <li>
                            Graham
                        </li>
                        <div class="img2"><img src="graham.jpg" height="700px" width="800px" alt="this is an image of the ernie davis dining hall"></div>
                        <ul>
                            Salad bar is elite, you can put grilled chicken on it and they have grilled cheese that you dont need to ask the sandwhich bar to make.</ul>
                        <li>Shaw</li>
                        <div class="img3"><img src="shaw.jpg" height="700px" width="800px" alt="this is an image of the rober shaw dining hall"></div>
                        <ul>Milkshakes and a kosher section. The actual dining hall is very cute it looks like a upscale diner</ul>
                        <li>Sadler</li>
                        <div class="img4"><img src="sadler.jpg" height="700px" width="800px" alt="this is an image of the sadler dining hall"></div>
                        <ul> Painfully mid</ul>
                        <div class="img5"><img src="sadler2.jpg" height="700px" width="800px" alt="this is an image of the second picture of the sadler dining hall"></div>
                        <li>BBB</li>
                        <div class="img6"><img src="bbb.jpg" height="700px" width="800px" alt="this is an image the BBB dining hall"></div>
                        <ul>I once got a waffle here and it was hard as a rock I could knock on it. Also BBB is not in the bast location. </ul>
