       <p1> I'm currently majoring in Information management and technology, and public health. IMT is such a dynamic major and is changing every day and more specifically within IMT, I'm interested in data analytics.
        <br>Public health has really intrigued me this past year with covid and how each country is dealing with it and each demographic. <br>
        Outside of school I love snowboarding, playing lacrosse, and running. <br>
        One of my favorite accomplishments is that I won first place in a French poetry contest and that I raised 5,000 dollars for leukemia and lymphoma society.<br>
         On-campus I’m involved in OrangeSeeds, U100, the women’s network, and PSP. I love dogs, I have a west highland terrier and I'm from long island, new york. </p1>
